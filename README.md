# hello-world
This will be my 1st GitHub repsodsisd. Something like hello-world and whatnot . Wish me luck, cuz shit is about to get real :P
So i returned, and write this so i can later delete this so that i can try to understsatas how this works. So dont mind me mate, just do your work ...
Hoho, im coming along nice and clean, from my prespective.So now i need to write about myself appereantlyrss. Welp, im still alive, thats all you need to know about me i guess? but i cant be sure about future though. still gotta do my best. So can i call this shit my will, like when smth happens. now now dont question me about anythig material, cuz even me myself dont have anything, so dont expect a shit from me. But i spent my time writing this, any you wasted your time reading this, so this is all i need to know to fell better ^^. But to be honest, i dont think anybody other than me going to read this, so cya later.
Yo, now that im looking back here, like 2 min passed last time i was here, but anyways, dont sweat the little stuff, so yeah, im just noticing that i haven't written any hello world code. Like, dude, i just named my repsidirsdofs hello-world. But im still not sure if this repsidotre is where we need to write code. Like there was smth named project or whatnot in my accaunt? welp, whatever. Imma gonna write my hello worod code here. Behold my mighty instructions.

using System;

namespace Hello_worod
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}

Welp, i ceartinly didn't copy-paste it by creating new console project. Whatever...
